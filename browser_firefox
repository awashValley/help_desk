// Turn off Geolocation in Firefox
  - Disabling geolocation in the Firefox browser requires accessing the advanced configuration setting. 
  Simply type about:config in the address bar of Firefox and hit the enter key on the keyboard. 
  Click the box “I’ll be careful, I promise!” to proceed using the option.
  - In the filter box, type geo. (Type the keyword geo with a period at the end) 
    The browser should display two preference names: geo.enabled and geo.wifi.uri. 
    - Double-click geo.enabled to disable geolocation. 
    - Double-click geo.wifi.uri and then type localhost to replace the web address, https://www.google.com/loc/json.
